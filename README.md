# Miranda IM 111 Pack

Museum for _**Miranda IM 111 Pack**_ source code and [latest installer](miranda_im_111.exe) (v0.9.40.0). I don't remember when it was released but Miranda IM v0.9.40 was released on 2011-12-31 and Miranda IM v0.9.41 was released on 2012-01-09.

The installer has an option of creating a folder with source code. You can also open **miranda_im_111.exe** with 7zip and find source code in `$DESKTOP\Miranda IM 111 Pack Source Code` folder. See license info there and in installer dialogs.

Actually it's a source code for the pack but not for the Miranda IM and plugins. See their source code on the [Miranda IM site](http://www.miranda-im.org/development/) ([at sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/p/miranda/svn/HEAD/tree/)).

P.S.

I guess it can be ported to [Miranda NG](https://github.com/miranda-ng/miranda-ng) or the current version of [Miranda IM](http://www.miranda-im.org/) (they might be useful Jabber clients that support encryption and GPG - check it yourself). But I have no intension to do so.
